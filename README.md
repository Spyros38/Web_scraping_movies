# Web_scraping_movies
This script is an intro on how we can scrape info from websites.
More specifically, one script is about scraping and formating news from the website "Y Hacker News" and the other file is about "The 100 Greatest Movies" from the website "empireonline".
The packages that are used for this project are "requests" and "bs4" - "beautifulsoup4".
